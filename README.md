# Visual Effects (VFX) Project ðŸŒŸðŸŽ‡

## ðŸŽ¨ Project Overview

In this project, I explored **particles** and **visual effects** in Unity to enhance scenes with dynamic effects. I experimented with Unityâ€™s Particle Systems and VFX Graph, learning how to choose and configure these tools to create both environmental and burst effects.

## ðŸš€ What I Learned

- **Choosing the Right Tool:**  
  Learned how to decide between using **Unityâ€™s Particle System** or **VFX Graph** depending on the projectâ€™s needs.

- **Producing Effects:**  
  Configured **environmental** and **burst effects** using Unity's **Particle System**. This includes managing emission, shape, and color over time.

- **VFX Graph:**  
  Interpreted and modified a simple **VFX Graph** to understand how different nodes work together to create complex visual effects.

- **Synthesis of Skills:**  
  Applied newly gained VFX skills to meet specific project requirements, creating a visually engaging and dynamic scene.
